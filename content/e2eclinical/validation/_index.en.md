Validation and qualification are two important topics in regulatory interactions. Roche, GSK and Novartis
have an on-going collaboration to extend the ideas in the R Validation Hub, and using new tools like 
`covtracer`, to automate via CICD tools validation (and re-validation) of packages once we feel 
the quality of their documentation 
and unit testing is sufficient. `thevalidatoR` represents a simplified version of this 
approach.
