#Objective

The objective of pharmaverse is to bring together a collection of pharmaceutical industry representatives to agree on a curated and opinionated subset of open-source software packages and codebases, which would be based on the R language and those that we believe are the most suitable for the industry to adopt in order to deliver the clinical data pipeline. If suitable tools do not already exist within the open-source ecosystem, these gaps can be identified. Then via collective collaboration (around development and testing), new solutions may be developed with the aim to reduce duplication of efforts and gain increased harmonization to the way we work across the industry.

There would be no commercial interest from contributors to any of these efforts, as all code will be targeted for open-source release under a permissive license.

The benefits would be as follows:
●	Industry collaboration leading to more robust and well-thought-out solutions with shared development and maintenance efforts, thus distributing the cost and burden across multiple organizations
●	Greater potential to bring unified solutions to regulators demonstrating collaboration between industry and standards organization to form workable solutions
●	Better enablement of our medicines to reach patients and society faster through the pooling of skills and talents and accelerating how the industry generates insights from patients’ data - and to do this in a more sustainable way
●	Attraction of the next generation of great software developers and data scientists to Pharma and providing increased transparency of our industry
