This list encapsulates all the open source R packages we have found that fall under the scope of usage for e2e clinical reporting in pharma. Over time the pharmaverse council will endeavour to curate this into an “opinionated” stack. 

_**If you have a package that you feel fits within the scope of the pharmaverse then please reach out to any of our council reps.**_

### _IN DEVELOPMENT_

This section highlights those packages we are aware of which are still under development (and not yet open source released), but will likely form part of the pharmaverse in future. If you are considering developing a package with a similar scope to any of the below, we encourage you first make contact with the lead developer to discuss whether a collaboration may be possible.
