{{< notice "info" >}}
As of Dec 2021, there are no R packages released either as closed source 
collaborations between companies, or our gold standard of open sourced.
 If you are considering developing a package with a similar scope to any of the below, we encourage you first make contact with the lead developer to discuss whether a collaboration may be possible.
{{< /notice >}}

[According to CDISC:](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/stdm) SDTM provides a standard for organizing and formatting data to streamline processes in collection, management, analysis and reporting. Implementing SDTM supports data aggregation and warehousing; fosters mining and reuse; facilitates sharing; helps perform due diligence and other important data review activities; and improves the regulatory review and approval process. 

SDTM is one of the required standards for data submission to FDA (U.S.) and PMDA (Japan).

**Upcoming packages**

Some gaps which we are interested to start new package collaborations for are as follows:
- applying a **datacut** to SDTM  
- removing/adding **supplemental qualifiers** from/to the parent SDTM domain
Please reach out to Ross Farrugia (ross.farrugia@roche.com) if interested to join either efforts.
