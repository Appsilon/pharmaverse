TLG related packages have been broken down into three themes:

- **Templates**: packages that allow the creation of TLGs that meet specific standards. This often means they are 'wrapper' packages, that create specific TLGs like a table 1, or a kaplan mier plot.
- **Execution**: packages that provide the engine to create the plot, table or listing. These are more extensible packages. 
- **Orchestration**: packages (or tools) that help facillitate the orchestration of templates and execution packages to be run over a series of planned outputs.
