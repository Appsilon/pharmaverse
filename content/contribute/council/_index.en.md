**Council Structure**

The initial Council is comprised of 1 representative from each of Roche, GSK, Atorus, and Janssen/J&J, with a commitment at least through September 30, 2023. 
As of October 1, 2022, the Council will expand by 3 organizations, each with one representative and a 2-year commitment. On October 1 of each subsequent year, 
any Council member organization with an expiring commitment may remain on the Council with a renewed 2-year commitment. If a Council member organization leaves, 
they will be replaced by another Organization with one representative and a 2-year commitment. There is no restriction on the type of organization that may be 
part of the Council (e.g., pharma, CRO, vendor, or regulatory). In the event of a vacancy on the Council, any Council member may nominate a replacement 
organization to fill the vacancy. Acceptance to the Council 2-year term is granted by the existing council, inclusive of outgoing membership. 

It is expected that a Council member organization contribute:
*	One representative to the Council
*	Commitment to at least 2 open source packages under pharmaverse via reviews, hands-on code development, product leads, or other roles which contribute to the 
design, development, testing, release, and/or maintenance     
 
**Council Activities** 

(What does the Council do?)
*	Renders (or delegates the rendering of) the 'opinionated' element of 'an opinionated set of packages'
*	Sets the strategy for pharmaverse
*	Governs packages within the pharmaverse: What's in and what's out; What's recommended to practitioners and what’s not; Sets the requirements for a package 
to be included in the pharmaverse
*	Support organizations developing candidate packages
*	Provides guidance on release train planning (ongoing maintenance, development and release): Determines the platform(s) to distribute code; Oversees the 
Communications plan for new package releases (including new versions)
*	Initiates projects or workshops
*	Pursues regulatory engagement to advance the pharmaverse initiative
*	Provides oversight for managed contracts for collaborations - to ensure no conflicts – NOT LEGAL GUIDANCE!
*	Leads by example – models Development Team structure and collaborative model
*	Determines the course of the 'pharmaverse' as an entity:	Does it become a stand-alone organization? Does it require funding?	Should it be self-sufficient?
*	Establishes and maintains a Free agent board - programmers looking for teams - teams looking for programmers

The Council does not accept organizations into the pharmaverse. Any organization can be a member - any individual can contribute.
Any decision rendered by the Council will be determined by majority vote of the Council membership where at least 60% of the Council is present. In the event 
of a tie, keep talking and figure it out.

**Council Meetings** 

*	Monthly - 1h agenda from topics as described above (to be determined by Council members).      
*	There is an expectation of Council member action items to be completed between Council meetings
