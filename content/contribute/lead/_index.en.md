We openly welcome developers of existing packages or those initiating new packages to reach out to us.

In order for pharmaverse to be truly successful we need to encourage that any gaps in the end-to-end clinical reporting flow are addressed by new collaborative efforts, 
rather than many individual companies addressing the same problem in isolation - which at worst ends with private code and at best ends with a proliferation of open 
source code all doing the same thing.

So we actively encourage individuals or organisations that have an idea for a new R package within our pharmaverse scope to contact our council representatives, so that 
we can help you initiate a new collaboration with like-minded other individuals. We can also connect you with others that would be willing to contribute to testing 
your package as you progress development.

Before you contact us, please consider whether there is already an existing pharmaverse package that could solve your need, or if you could combine forces
with an existing effort to add your feature to their package. Our aim is always to reduce repetition across our packages, so as to provide a lower bar for
pharmaceutical companies to adopt R. With this in mind, expect that we would say no to including a new package in pharmaverse unless it offers unique features
and scope compared to the packages already included.

If you would like to see your package included in pharmaverse, then the following are our minimal required criteria for all our packages:
* MIKE TO ADD LIST...
* If you meet all of the above criteria, one of our respective working groups will review your package and determine whether the scope is suitable and the package
adds sufficient value to pharmaverse.

The responsibilities of package co-leads (both for new or existing packages) include:
* Deciding the strategy for the package, such as scope, contribution model, testing, governance, maintenance and communication planning - for each of these points 
there exists high level guidance and pharmaverse recommendations within our charter.

For new package collaborations, beyond our charter we also offer the following to help you get started:
* A [collaboration contract template](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaverse/blob/main/content/contribute/Pharmaverse%20Collaborative%20Agreement%20(template).docx) - 
as you see there our recommendation is to target permissive licensing (such as [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) or 
[Apache 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)), but this is only a template and all decisions need to be considered with the respective legal groups of the 
companies involved.
* A [GitHub template](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiraltemplate) focused on the {admiral} family of packages and their conventions, but could be useful as an
example of possible approaches to use, such as Issue and Pull Request templates.
* [Developer utilities](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/) and [CI/CD workflows](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralci/) again focused on the {admiral} family of packages, but could be useful to re-use.
* Example [contribution model](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/contribution_model.html) - this is what is used for the {admiral} package and includes 
vignettes around programming strategy, unit testing guidance and git usage. This model will evolve over time as the admiral team learn from the experience, but could 
serve as an example to consider if you will open your package for contributions, which we would recommend.
* Recommended [support model](https://pharmaverse.org/support/) - this is important to give users a consistent experience across pharmaverse packages, and if packages 
are not kept well maintained and supported then they are likely to be removed from the pharmaverse package list.
* R package validation strategy - we currently are connecting with several companies and industry working groups to assess whether there could be an industry 
recommended approach to R package validation utilising open source packages. Until we have this, we'd be happy to share our learnings and current strategies in this area.
* Option to include a pharmaverse [hosted shield/badge](https://pharmaverse.org/contribute/badges/) for your package which shows users you are part of pharmaverse 
thus adding an extra level of credibility.
