Our working groups are listed towards the bottom of our homepage, and these may expand into new areas over time.

Some guiding principles are as follows:

- The council will look to rely on specialist experts from the working groups to make recommendations on which packages to include and
identifying gaps in the pharmaverse. The Data WG covers areas such as STDM and ADaM, the TLG WG covers TLGs and interactive apps, and
the Technology WG covers any other packages and our website
- Each WG nominates a lead
- The members of each group are empowered to agree on any additional scope, objectives and deliverables
- We should not duplicate efforts from any other [industry working groups](https://pharmaverse.org/opensource/)

Membership is not linked to any specific organizations. Any individual is able to join our pharmaverse working groups, as long as able 
to add value in the required area.

If you are interested in joining any working group, reach out to any of the council representatives or WG members, and the WG lead
would have final say on who joins.
