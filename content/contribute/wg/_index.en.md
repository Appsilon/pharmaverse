Our working groups are listed towards the bottom of our homepage, and these may expand into new areas over time. The members of each 
group are empowered to agree on scope, objectives and deliverables. 

Some guiding principles are as follows:
- We should not duplicate efforts from any other [industry working groups](https://pharmaverse.org/opensource/)
- The council will look to rely on specialist experts from the working groups to make recommendations on which packages to include and
identifying gaps in the pharmaverse

Membership is not linked to any specific organizations. Any individual is able to join our pharmaverse working groups, as long as able 
to add value in the required area.

If you are interested in joining any working group, reach out to any of the council representatives, who would have final say on who joins.
