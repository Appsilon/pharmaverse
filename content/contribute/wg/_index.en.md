When pharmaverse first started we felt important to have our own working groups to drive topics of interest, but through
our partnership with PHUSE we recognise that we could have more impact in collaboration so we recommend people towards
contributing to the [Data Visualisation & Open Source Technology (DVOST) working group](https://advance.phuse.global/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=327777)
projects.

Instead of working groups, we feel the strength of pharmaverse is bringing like-minded people together to support and
knowledge share to help accelerate one another's efforts.

The following are our currently active sub-communities:

- **Package maintainers** (lead: michael.s.rimler@gsk.com) - _It's not easy taking the burden of maintaining a package, so any package leaders for pharmaverse packages have each other to lean on as a support network!_
- **R Adoption** (lead: juha-pekka.perttola@roche.com) - _Connecting R enablement/strategy leads for clinical reporting from pharmaceutical companies to share the challenges of embedding R usage in this space._
- **Website** (lead: ross.farrugia@roche.com) - _To maintain our website and our end-to-end examples._

Membership of these communities are not linked to any specific organizations. Any individual can request to join our pharmaverse working groups, as long as able 
to add value in the required area.

If you are interested in joining, reach out to the respective lead above, as they would have final say on who joins.
