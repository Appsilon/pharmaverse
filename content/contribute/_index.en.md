Our [pharmaverse charter] (https://pharmaverse.org/charter/) shares the 3 possible contribution levels of Individual contributor, Package co-lead, or Council representative. 
Here is more detailed guidance on each:

### Individual Contributor

This will encompass the majority of our community and encapsulates those using and contributing to the development of any pharmaverse package. Examples of how you could get involved to help us achieve our vision:
* Use existing recommended packages and advocate usage within your organisation
* Raise feedback via Issues for areas where you find potential package enhancements or bugs
* For those packages with an open contribution model, develop new functionality and make pull requests to make your code available for re-use
* For new pharmaverse package collaborations, volunteer for user testing to help the development team build robust solutions

### Package Co-lead

In order for pharmaverse to be truly successful we need to encourage that any gaps in the e2e clinical reporting flow are addressed by new collaborative efforts, rather than many individual companies addressing the same problem in isolation - which at worst ends with private code and at best ends with a proliferation of open source code all doing the same thing.
So we actively encourage individuals or organisations that have an idea for a new R package within our pharmaverse scope to reach out to our council members, so that we can help you initiate a new collaboration with like-minded other individuals. We can also connect you with organisations that would be willing to contribute to testing your package as you progress development.
The responsibilities of package co-leads (both for new or existing packages) include:
* Deciding the strategy for the package, such as scope, contribution model, testing, governance, maintenance and communication planning - for each of these points there exists high level guidance and pharmaverse recommendations within our charter
For new package collaborations, beyond our charter we also offer the following to help you get started:
* Collaboration contract templates, including licensing recommendations _(Add Link later)_
* Example contribution guidelines and programming style guide _(Add Link later)_
* R package validation strategy _(Add Link later)_

### Council Representative

_Add detail from council founding principles doc later once finalised_
