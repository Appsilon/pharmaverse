Our [pharmaverse charter](https://pharmaverse.org/charter/) shares the 3 possible contribution levels of Individual contributor, Package co-lead, or Council representative. 
Here is more detailed guidance on each:

### Individual Contributor

This will encompass the majority of our community and encapsulates those using and contributing to the development of any pharmaverse package. Examples of how you could get involved to help us achieve our vision:
* Use existing recommended packages and advocate usage within your organisation
* Raise feedback via Issues for areas where you find potential package enhancements or bugs
* For those packages with an open contribution model, develop new functionality and make pull requests to make your code available for re-use
* For new pharmaverse package collaborations, volunteer for user testing to help the development team build robust solutions

### Package Co-lead

In order for pharmaverse to be truly successful we need to encourage that any gaps in the e2e clinical reporting flow are addressed by new collaborative efforts, rather than many individual companies addressing the same problem in isolation - which at worst ends with private code and at best ends with a proliferation of open source code all doing the same thing.

So we actively encourage individuals or organisations that have an idea for a new R package within our pharmaverse scope to reach out to our council members, so that we can help you initiate a new collaboration with like-minded other individuals. We can also connect you with others that would be willing to contribute to testing your package as you progress development.

The responsibilities of package co-leads (both for new or existing packages) include:
* Deciding the strategy for the package, such as scope, contribution model, testing, governance, maintenance and communication planning - for each of these points there exists high level guidance and pharmaverse recommendations within our charter.

For new package collaborations, beyond our charter we also offer the following to help you get started:
* A [collaboration contract template](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaverse/blob/main/content/contribute/Pharmaverse%20Collaborative%20Agreement%20(template).docx) - as you see there our recommendation is to target permissive licensing (such as [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) or [Apache 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)), but this is only a template and all decisions need to be considered with the respective legal groups of the companies involved.
* Example [contribution model](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/contribution_model.html) - this is what is used for the {admiral} package and includes vignettes around programming strategy, unit testing guidance and git usage. This model will evolve over time as the admiral team learn from the experience, but could serve as an example to consider if you will open your package for contributions, which we would recommend.
* Recommended [support model](https://pharmaverse.org/support/) - this is important to give users a consistent experience across pharmaverse packages, and if packages are not kept well maintained and supported then they are likely to be removed from the pharmaverse package list.
* R package validation strategy - we currently are connecting with several companies and industry working groups to assess whether there could be an industry recommended approach to R package validation utilising open source packages. Until we have this, we'd be happy to share our learnings and current strategies in this area.

### Council Representative

**Council Structure**

The initial Council is comprised of 1 representative from each of Roche, GSK, Atorus, and Janssen/J&J, with a commitment at least through September 30, 2023. As of October 1, 2022, the Council will expand by 3 organizations, each with one representative and a 2-year commitment. On October 1 of each subsequent year, any Council member organization with an expiring commitment may remain on the Council with a renewed 2-year commitment. If a Council member organization leaves, they will be replaced by another Organization with one representative and a 2-year commitment. There is no restriction on the type of organization that may be part of the Council (e.g., pharma, CRO, vendor, or regulatory). In the event of a vacancy on the Council, any Council member may nominate a replacement organization to fill the vacancy. Acceptance to the Council 2-year term is granted by the existing council, inclusive of outgoing membership. 

It is expected that a Council member organization contribute:
*	One representative to the Council
*	Commitment to at least 2 open source packages under pharmaverse via reviews, hands-on code development, product leads, or other roles which contribute to the design, development, testing, release, and/or maintenance     
 
**Council Activities** 

(What does the Council do?)
*	Renders (or delegates the rendering of) the 'opinionated' element of 'an opinionated set of packages'
*	Sets the strategy for pharmaverse
*	Governs packages within the pharmaverse: What's in and what's out; What's recommended to practitioners and what’s not; Sets the requirements for a package to be included in the pharmaverse
*	Support organizations developing candidate packages
*	Provides guidance on release train planning (ongoing maintenance, development and release): Determines the platform(s) to distribute code; Oversees the Communications plan for new package releases (including new versions)
*	Initiates projects or workshops
*	Pursues regulatory engagement to advance the pharmaverse initiative
*	Provides oversight for managed contracts for collaborations - to ensure no conflicts – NOT LEGAL GUIDANCE!
*	Leads by example – models Development Team structure and collaborative model
*	Determines the course of the 'pharmaverse' as an entity:	Does it become a stand-alone organization? Does it require funding?	Should it be self-sufficient?
*	Establishes and maintains a Free agent board - programmers looking for teams - teams looking for programmers

The Council does not accept organizations into the pharmaverse. Any organization can be a member - any individual can contribute.
Any decision rendered by the Council will be determined by majority vote of the Council membership where at least 60% of the Council is present. In the event of a tie, keep talking and figure it out.

**Council Meetings** 

*	Monthly - 1.5h agenda from topics as described above (to be determined by Council members).      
*	There is an expectation of Council member action items to be completed between Council meetings
