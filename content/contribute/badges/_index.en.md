For packages we include in the pharmaverse, we generate and host sheilds/badges
that the package authors are free to use on their packages. 

There is no requirement to use these badges, and we reserve the right to 
stop hosting the the badge if the package is deemed to no longer be 
relevant to the pharmaverse.

To use, just copy and paste the markdown code in the column 'Markdown' for the
package you are a maintainer of.

### Example

You can see an example of the badge in use on the `thevalidatoR` Github repo.
