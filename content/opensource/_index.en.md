Please find below some links to other useful resources around supporting open sourcing to help the industry with clinical reporting.
* Openpharma [GitHub org](https://github.com/openpharma) and [health/activity tracker](https://openpharma.github.io/) providing a sister pharmaceutical open sourcing initiative that is completely un-opinionated and has a wider remit spanning discovery to access across any programming language.
* [PHUSE Working Groups](https://advance.phuse.global/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=327777) supporting industry adoption of open source technology, such as by assessing the fundamental differences in statistical analysis results across languages and how we can mitigate such risk and maintain confidence in open source languages.
* [R Consortium Working Groups](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-working-groups) focused around industry R enablement, such as by working with FDA to pilot fully R-based submissions. 
* [R Validation Hub](https://www.pharmar.org/) designing a framework that assesses the quality of an R package and considering topics around R package validation in accordance with regulatory standards.
* [CDISC Open-Source Alliance (COSA)](https://cosa.cdisc.org/) supports, promotes, and sometimes sponsors open source software projects that create tools for implementing or developing CDISC standards to drive innovation in the CDISC community. An example of open source work being led out of CDISC would be [CORE](https://www.cdisc.org/core), where the objective is to provide an open source executable suite of CDISC conformance checks.
* A [collection](https://www.glacon.eu/portal/overviewVisual.html) of open source solutions, programs and scripts for clinical study evaluations covering numerous programming languages, maintained by Katja Glass.

If you find any other useful open source resources that you think should be included here, then please don't hesitate to reach out to one of our council reps via the contact details listed at the bottom section of the front page of our website.
