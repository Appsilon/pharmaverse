### Installing for GxP use

In an internal regulatory setting, you are likely to have your own agreed package management solutions and your own mirror of CRAN.

### Installing from r-universe.org

We currently also have an [r-universe build](https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev/ui#builds) available for ease of use outside 
GxP settings.

```r
# Enable this universe
options(
    repos = c(
    pharmaverse = 'https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev',
    CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'
    )
  )
```

As of today there are [![:total status badge](https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev/badges/:total)](https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev)  from the pharmaverse hosted in this CRAN-like instance.
