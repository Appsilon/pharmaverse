{{< faq "How can I get access to these packages?" >}}
While it's likely in a production use of the packages you will be maintaining your own CRAN-like library within your company, for exploration and development purposes any of the hex logos shown above include a link direct to the Github repo of each package. We also host the packages, and their dependencies, in a CRAN-like server on R-universe. Please [follow this link](https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev/ui#builds) to see how to point add this CRAN-like server to your library list in R.

{{< faq "Is this validated/GxP/regulatory assured?" >}}
No, but we do provide testing guidance _(Add link)_ for those developing pharmaverse packages as well as a possible R package validation strategy _(Add link)_ for organisations looking to adopt.
