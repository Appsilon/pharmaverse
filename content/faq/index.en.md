{{< faq "Who decides what's in and not in the pharmaverse?" >}}
This is governed by our pharmaverse working groups - see our [Contribute](https://pharmaverse.org/contribute/lead/) section of the site for more details. The working group contacts are given if you scroll down this page. Please reach out to us if you feel a package should be included, provided it offers significantly unique scope compared to the packages already included.

{{< faq "How can I get access to these packages?" >}}
While it's likely in a production use of the packages you will be maintaining your own CRAN-like library within your company, for exploration and development purposes any of the hex logos shown above include a link direct to the GitHub repo of each package. We also host the packages, and their dependencies, in a CRAN-like server on R-universe. Please [follow this link](https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev/ui#builds) to see how to point add this CRAN-like server to your library list in R. See information at [Get packages](https://pharmaverse.org/library/)

{{< faq "Is this validated/GxP/regulatory assured?" >}}
No, but we currently are connecting with several companies and industry working groups (see [Other Open Sourcing](https://pharmaverse.org/opensource/)) to assess whether there could be an industry recommended approach to R package validation utilising open source packages. Until we have this, weâ€™d be happy to share our learnings and current strategies in this area from the companies involved in pharmaverse.
