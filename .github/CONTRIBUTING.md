## Governance

Access to the repository is restricted to members of the council (GitHub organization admins) and the [website-maintainers team](https://github.com/orgs/pharmaverse/teams/website-maintainers). Any external contributions must be made through pull requests from a forked repository. For further information on access, see the [repo access settings](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaverse/settings/access).

---

## Branching and Deployment Strategy

1. **Default Branch**: The default branch is `develop`. All pull requests (PRs) must go through the `develop` branch before being merged into `main`.
2. **Deployment Pipeline**: Our GitHub Actions [pipeline](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaverse/blob/develop/.github/workflows/pipeline.yml) deploys code from the `main` and `develop` branches (to production and a testing space).
3. **Branch Lifecycle**: Once a branch has been deployed to `develop`, it should be deleted.
4. **Issue Tracking**: We utilize [issue templates](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaverse/tree/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) for reporting bugs and requesting features.
